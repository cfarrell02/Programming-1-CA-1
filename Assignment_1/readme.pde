Brief description of the animation achieved: A simple 2D sidescrolling jumping game. A square is "moving" along a landscape and must jump to avoid obstacles.
The player can use the spacebar to initiate one jump, the square remains horizontally stationary and the obstacles move towards it continuously being reset to the right each time it passes the square.  A score counter is updated after every successful jump.

Known bugs/problems: n/a
